# SCI-FI-demo-3D-fps-mission-

This was a 3 man project for the course Comp 3300 at MUN

This is a fps game demo mission where the player has to buy a weapon from the market 
and learn how to shoot.

The player uses coins to get more ammo, the coins appear randomly in the scene

The player has to finish the whole tutorial to finish the game or the player can just play around in the game world.
